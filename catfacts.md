Cats have an extra “floating” collarbone setup, which helps them squeeze through surprisingly tiny gaps. If the head fits, the cat basically goes “cool, I live here now.”

A cat’s nose print is (basically) unique—like a little boop-shaped fingerprint.

Cats don’t taste sweetness the way humans do. Cake means nothing to them. Your feelings, however, mean even less.

Their whiskers are sensory super-tools.

Cats usually have 18 toes: 5 on each front paw, 4 on each back paw. (Polydactyl cats are the adorable rebels with extra toes.)

They sleep a lot—often 12–16 hours a day (and some even more). Professional nappers. Tenured professors of “do not disturb.”

A cat’s purr can happen not only when they’re happy, but also when they’re stressed or hurt—kind of like self-soothing mode.

Cats have a special reflective layer behind their retinas (tapetum lucidum) that helps them see in low light and gives them that spooky “glow” in photos.

They “mark” you by rubbing their face on you—scent glands on their cheeks leave a friendly little “this human is mine” signature.

Cats can make a ridiculous range of sounds; adult cats mostly meow at humans (not so much at other cats). Translation: you’ve been trained.
